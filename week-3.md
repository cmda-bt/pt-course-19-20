## Feedback moment

This meeting we will look at the work you have finished until now and give feedback:
* Job story
* Designs
* Static site

### Questions
Here are some questions you can ask yourself to prepare:

* **Planning** :
  * What's you current situation?
  * How much time are you spending on this project? Are you behind schedule?
  * What assignments do you still need to work on?
* **Job story**
  * Do you have a well written job story that also describes the context of the user?
  * Does the job story suit the requirements from the Backend course?
  * Does the job story suit the requirements from the Frontend course?
* **Research  & Design (wiki)** :
  * Does your wiki clearly show your research on existing apps?
  * Does your wiki clearly show your designs (style guide, wireframes, wireflow, etc.)
  * Does your wiki clearly show your research on code standards, code style, code editors and extensions, npm packages, template engines etc. ?
* **Static site (Github repository)** :
  * Does your static site provide a good solution for your job story?
  * Do you use Git to keep track of different versions of your code? Do you have clear commit messages?
  * Do you have a markdown readme file to inform others about what your project is about?


## Homework

### I. Start building your feature
 Start working on your feature for the dynamic web app using the knowledge from the backend and frontend courses. Do you already know which routes you need to implement? Can you create some templates already? Where are you going to implement a progressively enhanced feature? 

### II. Perform technical research
 Add a page to your wiki to show what kind of technical research you do this week. For example which template engine you are going to use, or which npm packages your are going to use.

 ### Tips

 * Create a [comparison chart](https://www.cmdmethods.nl/cards/stepping-stones/comparison-chart) where you compare different technical solutions.
