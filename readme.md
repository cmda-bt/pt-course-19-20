## Description

Project Tech is a first stepping stone for you to become a well-rounded web
developer (or a designer with knowledge of how things are made).
This course continues where earlier courses left off with HTML, CSS, JS,
research, design, project management, etcetera.

We’ll focus on what it means to be a web dev, the current landscape of that
space, and topics such as code quality, ethics, privacy, security, empathy,
diversity, inclusion, accessibility, communication, time management, team work,
and more.

You’ll learn about those “softer” skills and “harder” essentials such as how to
use the command line, a text editor, version control, and build tools.

## Communication

*   [GitHub][self] — Everything’s here!
*   [Slack][] (`#project-tech` channel) — General chatter and Q&A
*   Brightspace — Nothing

## Goals

### Main goal

The goal of this course is that **you’re able to function as a well-rounded (but
novice) web developer on a team**.

### Subgoals

*   Understand the history of coding (lab 1)
*   Navigate the command line (lab 1)

## Assessment

For this course you’ll build a *dynamic* and *working* prototype, in a team of
3, with the knowledge and skills acquired in backend and frontend.
This means that people can *actually* sign up and add or like something.
*Not* that it is a finished project that is fast, beautiful, secure, scalable,
or ready to be used right away.

What you’ll make is up to the team, but it *must* be a dating site, made with
Node.js, a database, HTML, CSS, and client-side JS.

It is important that your team makes decisions together based on consensus, and
everyone applies the knowledge and skills acquired in courses (such as that
every team member works with templates), and *not* that one person only does
CSS and the person with pre-existing knowledge does the whole backend or makes
all decisions.

Progress would look something like this:

*   Week 1: Do research and come up with a concept
*   Week 2: Set up project, write a readme, make a sitemap and sketches, paper
    prototype
*   Week 3: HTML, CSS
*   Week 4: Routes, templates, render data
*   Week 5: Data model, database, GET
*   Week 6: Accounts (signing up, logging in and out), POST, DELETE
*   Week 7: Matching, usability, progressive enhancement, should-haves
*   Week 8: Deploy, finish up, could-haves

Of course, it’s expected that the progress in practice is more chaotic and
iterative.

It’s often relatively easy to come up with a very complex idea, but it’s
typically hard to *actually* make that idea into reality.
Keep your concept as basic as possible (while meeting this course’s criteria).
Focus on the essentials and when done with those, start adding bells and
whistles.

### Grade

This course is assessed through an oral knowledge test where you present your
team’s work.
You are graded individually.

Grades for the course follow standard academic grading of the Netherlands.
The scale ranges from 1 (very poor) to 10 (outstanding) with marks to one
decimal place (such as 7.2).
The lowest pass mark is 5.5.

### Attendance

This course is highly participatory.
You are expected to contribute to discussions and give feedback to peers.
Attendance to class is not compulsory, but 80% of success is showing up, so show
up.

This course includes team work.
Everybody hates that one team mate that doesn’t do anything.
Don’t be that team mate.
Participation in team work is compulsory and part of your grade.

This course does not have office hours.
Use Slack and show up in class instead.

## Bugs

If you have questions:

*   Read the manual for the technology in question
    ([Git](https://git-scm.com/docs),
    [GitHub](https://guides.github.com))
*   [Search StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
*   [Use a search engine like DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)
*   [Ask questions on Slack][slack]
*   [Contact a lecturer](#synopsis)

## Health

**Please take care of yourself**.
Eat well, exercise, get enough sleep.
A healthy lifestyle improves your chances of succeeding this period and to cope
with study stress (concentration problems, exam stress, failure anxiety,
procrastination)

If you are experiencing difficulties, know that help is available.
Please contact your [student counsellor][counsel] for help with study stress,
dyslexia, disabilities, chronic illness, personal problems, etc.

## Conduct

This course has a [code of conduct][coc].
Anyone interacting with this repository, organization, or community is bound by
it.

Staff and students of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (Hogeschool
van Amsterdam) are additionally bound by the [regulation undesirable
conduct][ruc] ([regeling ongewenst gedrag][rog]).

## Privacy

GDPR and the [Privacy statement of our university][privacy] ensure the
confidentiality of student records.

An important part of the educational experience of becoming a web developer is
to exit the walled garden that is education and to participate, collaborate, and
join the conversation happening around you on the internet.
Which is what we’ll do in this course.

Students are sometimes reluctant to share work online as they are afraid of
negative feedback.
Typically though, poor quality work is ignored rather than ridiculed (in fact,
most work is ignored).
Good work in a course like this is instead used by students to land future job
offers, and the experience of collaborating online often provides a positive
transformative experience.

## Semester

The first three semesters at [**@cmda**][program] are a joint program that
provides the fundamental knowledge to design and build digital products.
In the fourth semester students can express individual interest as they take
electives courses that specialize in certain fields.
One of these electives is **project tech** (this course), which is chosen along
with **backend** and **frontend**, forming the cluster **block tech**.
Together, this cluster provides the essential knowledge needed to specialize in
building the web.
To continue with web development, choose **tech track** in semester 5 and
**minor everything web** in semester 6.

## Program

This course is given at [communication and multimedia design][program], a design
bachelor focused on interactive digital products and services.
CMD is part of the [faculty of digital media and creative industries][faculty]
at the [Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences][university].
