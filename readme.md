## Description

Project Tech is a first stepping stone for you to become a well-rounded web
developer (or a designer with knowledge of how things are made).
This course continues where earlier courses left off with topics such as HTML,
CSS, JS, research, design, and project management.

We‚Äôll focus on what it means to be a web dev, the current landscape of that
space, and topics such as ethics, privacy, security, empathy, diversity,
inclusion, accessibility, communication, time management, and team work.

You‚Äôll learn about those ‚Äúsofter‚Äù skills and ‚Äúharder‚Äù essentials such as how to
use the command line, a text editor, version control, build tools, and code
quality.

## Communication

*   [GitHub][self] ‚Äî Everything‚Äôs here!
*   [Slack][] (`#project-tech` channel) ‚Äî General chatter and Q&A
*   Brightspace ‚Äî Assessment and coaching scheduling

## Assessment

For this course you will build a *dynamic* and *working* prototype, in a team of
3, with knowledge and skills acquired in **[backend][be]** and
**[frontend][fe]**.
This means that people can *actually* sign up and add things.
*Not* that it is a finished project that is fast, beautiful, secure, scalable,
or ready to be used right away.

What you‚Äôll make is up to the team, but it *must* be a dating site, made with
Node.js, a database (Mongo?), HTML, CSS, and client-side JS.

It is important that your team makes decisions together based on consensus.
And that everyone applies knowledge and skills acquired in backend and frontend.
To illustrate, this means every team member works with templates.
*Not* that one person does CSS and the person with pre-existing knowledge
the whole backend.
So split work per feature (such as liking) instead of per area (such as
templating).

Progress would look something like this:

*   Week 1: Kickoff
*   Week 2: Research, concept, sitemap, sketches
*   Week 3: Project setup, readme, HTML, CSS, empty JS
*   Week 4: Routes, templates, render
*   Week 5: Create, update, delete
*   Week 6: Data model, database
*   Week 7: Accounts, matching, deploy
*   Week 8: Usability, progressive enhancement, finish up

Of course, it‚Äôs expected that progress in practice is more chaotic and
iterative.

It‚Äôs often relatively easy to come up with a complex idea.
It‚Äôs typically hard to make a complex idea into reality.
Keep your concept as basic as possible (while meeting this course‚Äôs criteria).
Focus on essentials first and add bells and whistles later.

###### Grade

This course is assessed through an oral knowledge test where each team presents
their work.
You are graded individually.
Some parts of your grade are based on your team‚Äôs achievements, some parts on
your role in them.

Grades for this course follow standard academic grading of the Netherlands.
The scale ranges from 1 (very poor) to 10 (outstanding).
We use marks to one decimal place (such as 7.2).
The lowest pass mark is 5.5.

###### Attendance

This course is highly participatory.
You are expected to contribute to discussions and give feedback to peers.
Attendance to class is not compulsory.
80% of success is showing up though, so show up.

This course includes team work.
Everybody hates that one team mate that doesn‚Äôt do anything.
Don‚Äôt be that team mate.
Participation in team work is compulsory and part of your grade.

This course does not have office hours.
Use Slack and show up in class instead.

## Bugs

If you have questions:

*   Read the manual for the technology in question
    ([Git](https://git-scm.com/docs),
    [GitHub](https://guides.github.com))
*   [Search StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
*   [Use a search engine like DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)
*   [Ask questions on Slack][slack]
*   [Contact a lecturer](#synopsis)

## Health

Please take care of yourself.
Eat well, exercise, get enough sleep.
A healthy lifestyle helps to cope with study stress and improves your chances of
succeeding this period.
Study stress includes for example concentration problems, exam stress, failure
anxiety, or procrastination.

If you are experiencing difficulties, know that help is available.
Please contact your [student counsellor][counsel] for help with study stress,
dyslexia, disabilities, chronic illness, personal problems, etc.
The [UvA psychologist‚Äôs office][psychologist] also offers various types of
support, such as workshops, training sessions, and consultation.
As a AUAS student you can get support and do not need a referral.

## Conduct

This course has a [code of conduct][coc].
Anyone interacting with this repository, organization, or community is bound by
it.

Staff and students of AUAS (HvA) are additionally bound by the [regulation
undesirable conduct][ruc] ([regeling ongewenst gedrag][rog]).

## Privacy

GDPR and our university‚Äôs [privacy statement][privacy] ensure the
confidentiality of student records.

An important part of the experience of becoming a web developer is to exit the
walled garden that is formal education.
To participate, collaborate, and join the conversation happening around you on
the internet.
Which is what we‚Äôll do in this course.
And why we asked you to sign a waiver to join this course.

Students are sometimes reluctant to share work online as they are afraid of
negative feedback.
Typically though, poor quality work is ignored rather than ridiculed (in fact,
most work is ignored).
Good work in a course like this is instead used by students to land job offers
in the future.
And the experience of collaborating online often provides a positive
transformative experience.

If you are afraid of stalkers, don‚Äôt want your family finding out what you work
on, or for other reasons want to stay anonymous in the online parts of our
course, you may use an anonymous username, email address, and avatar.

## Academic integrity

See our university‚Äôs sections on [copyright][] and [acknowledging
sources][acknowledge] and our program‚Äôs teaching and examination regulations
(available in Dutch as [onderwijs- en examenregeling][oer]) for information on
academic integrity.
To summarize our stance:
Credit awarded to a person should represent the work of that person.
Therefore, we expect that students produce their own original work.
Collaboration or assistance with work is not permitted unless explicitly
authorized by instructor(s).

It is required to cite all sources.
If collaboration or assistance is permitted by instructor(s), any collaboration
or assistance must be clearly acknowledged.
Failure to cite or acknowledge is grounds for a charge of cheating or
plagiarism.

Our program‚Äôs teaching and examination regulations ¬ß 4, specifically ¬∂ 4.4,
gives a definition of plagiarism, of which we paraphrased a couple here:

> b. presenting the structure or central ideas developed by someone else as your
> own work or ideas, even when a reference to other authors has been included;
>
> \[‚Ä¶]
>
> e. copying (parts of) media files or other sources, software source codes,
> models and other diagrams of other people without acknowledgement and allowing
> it to be held as your own work;

###### Help

In this course, we require you to collaborate with team members.
We also strongly urge you to help your class mates.
Please refrain from doing their work for them.
You can often tell when you cross that line.
Don‚Äôt cross it.
And always acknowledge when someone helped you.

###### Free and open source software

We strongly urge you to use free and open source software in the form of
libraries and require you to use Node.
If you find a project on GitHub (or similar platforms), that doesn‚Äôt mean that
you are allowed to use it.
Projects must have a license that explicitly lets you use it.
Acknowledge the authors of these works by citing their name and linking to their
projects.

## Program

This course is given at [communication and multimedia design][program], a design
bachelor focused on interactive digital products and services.
CMD is part of the [faculty of digital media and creative industries][faculty]
at the [Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences][university].

The first three semesters at [**@cmda**][program] are a joint program that
provides the fundamental knowledge to design and build digital products.
In the fourth semester students can express individual interest as they take
electives courses that specialize in certain fields.
One of these electives is **project tech** (this course), which is chosen along
with **[backend][be]** and **[frontend][fe]**, forming cluster **block tech**.
Together, this cluster provides essential knowledge needed to specialize in
building the web.
To continue with web development, choose **[tech track][tt]** in semester 5 and
**[minor everything web][ew]** in semester 6.
