## Grading Project tech
This project consists of two parts: first an [individual assignment][a1] (60%), then a [team assignment][a2] (40%). Both assignments get a grade (1-10) and both assignments have different weights in the calculation of the final grade of the project (60% for a1 individual, 40% for a2 team). The two assignments can compensate each other.

## Project Tech - Individual assignment
The first part of the project you will work individually on a job story. You will do research on existing dating apps and come up with a job story. You then start sketching and designing the components within your job story. You end with a working prototype of your job story using knowledge and skills acquired in backend and frontend.

Meanwhile you are researching code standards, code styles, how to setup a local development environment, how to setup a repository on Github and finally researching recent developments within the field of web development.



### Preperation
Presenting your work is a skill all by itself, make sure you prepare yourself properly. The best way is to treat it as [public speaking](https://abookapart.com/products/demystifying-public-speaking) and there are [many books](https://be.noti.st/2018/recommended-books-for-public-speakers) on public speaking available.
* Bring your own computer and a charger.
* Have the latest version of your code ready in your editor.
* Open up your docs inside of your GitHub repository.
* Have a live version up and running.

> Make sure your repository stays online after the oral test is finished, we might want to check the code handed in on GitHub after the test. We also want to download and archive your project when it’s done.
