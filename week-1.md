#### Description

For your project, perform contextual analysis by means of these steps. Look at existing dating (and also maybe other matching) sites and create an overview of characteristics. By doing this, you will get inspiration, insights and design patterns that you can use for your project.

1. Create a [benchmark](http://cmdmethods.nl/cards/library/benchmark-creation)

    Examples

    * e-matching: usefulness, but not too playful, free + paid (www.e-matching.nl)
    * tinder: swipe swipe, hands-on, quick, free (www.tinder.com)
    * inner circle: only via invite of members, free? (www.theinnercircle.co)
    * parship: questionnaire, serious dating, expensive (www.parship.nl)
    * happn: find people crossing your path, free? (www.happn.com/en)
    * lexa: search, swipe, badges, free + paid (extras) (www.lexa.nl)
    * our time (lexa 50+-ers) (www.ourtime.nl)
    * pepper: collage, free (www.pepper.nl)
    * zoosk: integrated facebook & google+ (www.zoosk.com)
    * victoria milan: dating for extramarital affairs (www.victoriamilan.nl)

        * =================

        * upgrade account (get extras)
        * sending messages
        * receiving messages
        * sending pictures
        * receiving pictures
        * chatting
        * facetime

      Make an inventory of playful user interactions

1. **Pages:**
Create a [page](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/#adding-pages) for this week or section of your research.

1. **Push your changes:**
Hand in your research in your repository on GitHub under your username.
