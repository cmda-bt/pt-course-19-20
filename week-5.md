## Assignments

### Flow

*   **Assignment**
*   **Time**: 1h

Take about 1h to investigate the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and research more of the ['social' features](https://guides.github.com/activities/socialize/) of GitHub.

* What is a `branch-based` workflow?
* What is a `pull-request`?
* What's `merging`?
* What's the point of `forking` a project?

**Extra resources**
* [GitHub Flow Guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
* [How to write a commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
* [Be Social Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/socialize/)

### Conflicts

*   **Assignment**
*   **Time**: 1h

Take about 1h to complete the [Managing Merge Conflicts course ](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) on GitHub lab. You will learn about resolving simple and complex merge conflicts with ease.

### Community

*   **Research**
*   **Time**: 1h

Take about 1h to complete the [Community Starter kit course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/community-starter-kit) on GitHub lab. You will learn how you cam make it easier for others to contribute to projects.

## Homework

### Pull request

*   **Homework**
*   **Time**: 3h

Make a _pull request_ to **three different repositories** of fellow student. You can **fix some of the feedback** from the issue of the last assignment or **rewrite a part of the application** based on your own findings. Did you do it in an alternative way? Can you make the code more readable?

* **Maintainer**: Have a good look at the incoming code from your fellow student. Does it adhere to your code standard? Do a thorough code review before you merge.
* **Contributor**: Before you make a _pull request_ have a look at any code standards that the repository of the maintainer is currently using. How is the folder structure set-up? What features of `js` does your fellow student use?

#### Methods
*   [Quality Review](www.cmdmethods.nl/cards/showroom/quality-review)
